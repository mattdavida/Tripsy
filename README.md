# Tripsy
A great way to stay more organized on your trips. 

Fullstack - M.E.A.N stack app (mongoDb, express, angular, node)

Database - the database includes a one one-to-many relationship between users and trips.

CRUD - the application supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting at least two entities (trips and users).

Security
Login/Registration - Users are able to register and login to the app.

Claims - Some users have privileges that are not shared with other users. For example, Admins can edit and delete users, Moderators can edit users, and users have no access to user management.
